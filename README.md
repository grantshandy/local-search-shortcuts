# Local Search Shortcuts

*Access more than 12,000 search engines with any browser or default search engine with a <3MB runtime memory background process.*

A local proxy service for redirecting to duckduckgo's [bangs](https://duckduckgo.com/bangs) feature in any search engine. All pre-loaded shortcuts are generated from [`bang.js`](https://duckduckgo.com/bang.js).

## Instructions:

After running, just set this as the search engine in your browser:
```
http://localhost:9321/?q=[TERMS]
```

Then use the many search engine shortcuts like so:
```
!w Hello World
```

This immediately (~15Î¼s) redirects to the Wikipedia page or search results.

For a complete list of loaded shortcuts, search `!info`.

## Configuration File

```toml
# Located at <CONFIG DIRECTORY>/local-search-shortcuts/config.toml or ./local-search-shortcuts.toml

port = 9321 # host on this port
broadcast = false # make accessible to other devices on the network
default = "DuckDuckGo" # the default search engine (duckduckgo, google, bing, etc.)

[engines]
homemanager = "https://home-manager-options.extranix.com/?query={s}"
# if "{s}" is not present, it will always just redirect regardless of the search terms
# now you can search for "!homemanager vim"
```

## Nix home-manager configuration

Just drop [`local-search-shortcuts.nix`](./local-search-shortcuts.nix) into your configuration and use like so:

```nix
imports = [ ./local-search-shortcuts.nix ];

services.local-search-shortcuts = {
    enable = true;
    firefoxSearch = true;
    settings = {
        default = "duckduckgo";
        engines.homemanager = "https://home-manager-options.extranix.com/?query={s}";
    };
};
```

And it will automatically set itself as your default firefox search engine and start when you log in!
